  <h2>Assignment 1</h2>

  <h3><i><b>Objectives</b></i></h3>

    <ul><b>
        <li>Create a Basic HTML document with HEAD & BODY sections</li>
        <li>Include list elements like, nested lists, ordered, unordered lists etc.</li>
        <li> Text alignment elements like, paragraphs, line breaks, horizontal lines etc.</li>
        <li>Formatting elements like, font, size, color etc.</li>
        <li> Hyperlinks, Image elements</li>
    </ul></b>
    <h4><i><b> The browser output should appear in the following form:</b></i></h2>
                 <pre>                                     <u><b>Building the Document Structure</b></u></pre>
        <h3> The two primary sections of an HTML document are</h3>
        <h3>1.HEAD</h3>
        <ul><b>
            <li> The Title tag in HEAD section gives the title to the Page</li>
        </ul></b>
        <h3>2.BODY</h3>   
        <ul><b>
            <li>Whatever is written in the BODY tag appears on the browser window</li>
            <li>Unordered lists can be created using the ul tag followed by li tags that list out the bulleted text. Li 
                tag can have the attribute, type = circle or disc or square</li>

            <li>Ordered lists can be created using the ol tag followed by li tags that list out the numbered text. Li tag can have the attribute, type = 1 or a or i or A or I</li>
           </b>
        <p>
    <hr>
        In addition to lists, the text can be “physically formatted” to appear either <b>bold </b> or <i>italicized</i> or <u>underlined</u> or
         <strike>strike through</strike>  or it could also be<sub>subscripted</sub>  or <sup>superscripted</sup> depending upon the need of the creator
            </p>
    <p>
    The text can be made to appear more attractive using fonts of various styles. The <i>font</i> tag does this job. The
     <b><i>face</i></b> attribute can change the font style to whichever it is equated to. The <i>size</i> attribute will 
    change the font size which can range from 1 to 7.<font color="red"><b>color attribute will obviously change font color if equated 
        to various combinations of RGB values</b></font>
     
    </p>
    <p>
        This apart if the background color has of the document has to be varied then, the bgColor attribute of the
        body tag can be set or the entire text can be aligned using the align attribute.Indentation with the help of the
        “paragraph tags” or a new line character with a line break can be achieved. Some special characters like 
        copyright i.e.  or registered trademark i.e.  that are not the part of a standard keyboard can be inserted 
        using the HTML character set. Apart from it, if the < & > signs are to displayed on the browser then 
        corresponding character set equivalent has to be chosen. Text alignment can be either left / center / right;
        this can be done using the div container tag that has the align attribute. You can set the alignment
        accordingly  
    </p>
    The power of net lies in its capacity to link various web pages scattered over different places on the net. 
    The web pages can be anchored to each other using the <i>a href</i> tags.
    For instance <A HREF = http://www.anuda.com/index.html >Click here</A> will link to the website
    referenced by HREF. The user interface becomes better looking if images are included using the <i>img</i> tag. Its 
    attributes <b>src, height, width, align, border</b> etc will produce corresponding effects. Images can be made 
    clickable if the <i>img</i> tag is contained within the anchor tags as demonstrated.

</p>
    <p><b>
        An image is to be inserted exactly at the bottom at the center position, should be square in shape with
        a border & should display a text when the mouse moves over it. Another clickable image that will lead
        to a different HTML page should also be inserted at the topmost portion of the web page, it should be
        wide enough to fit almost 75% of the page’s center
